## Reporting Issues

If you have found what you think is a bug,
please [file an issue](https://github.com/novasamatech/spektr-sdk/issues/new/choose).

## Suggesting new features

If you are here to suggest a feature, first create an issue if it does not already exist. From there, we will discuss
use-cases for the feature and then finally discuss how it could be implemented.

## Development

If you have been assigned to fix an issue or develop a new feature, please follow these steps to get started:

- Fork this repository.
- Install dependencies

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

  - We use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node versions - please make sure to use the version mentioned
    in `.nvmrc`

    ```shell
    nvm use
    ```

- Build all packages.

  ```shell
  npm run build
  ```

- Run development server.

  ```shell
  npm run build:watch
  ```

- Implement your changes and tests to files in the `src/` directory and corresponding test files.
- Document your changes in the appropriate doc page.
- Git stage your required changes and commit (see below commit guidelines).
- Submit PR for review.
